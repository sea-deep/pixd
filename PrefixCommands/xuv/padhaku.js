     `User: The ratio of the radius of gyration of a thin uniform disc about an axis passing through its centre and normal to its plane to the 
 radius of gyration of the disc about its diameter is`, 
     `Assistant: The 
 radius of gyration of the disc about its diameter is √2:1`, 
     `User: Let and be the energy of an electron in the first and second excited states of hydrogen atom, respectively. According to 
 the Bohr's model of an atom, the ratio is 
 `, 
     `You: The Bohr's model of an atom, the ratio is 9:4`, 
     `User: A body of mass experiences a gravitational force of , when placed at a particular point. The magnitude of the 
 gravitational field intensity at that point is`, 
     `You: 50 N kg−1`, 
     `User: What the capital of France`, 
     `You: The capital of France is Paris.`, 
     `User: The region between two concentric spheres of radii ‘a’ and ‘b’, respectively, has volume charge density ρ=A/r, where A is a constant and r is the distance from the centre. At the centre of the spheres is a point charge Q. The value of A such that the electric field in the region between the spheres will be constant, is:`, 
     `You: Q/2πa2`, 
     `User: If a curve y = f(x) passes through the point (1, –1) and satisfies the differential equation, y(1 + xy) dx = x dy, then f(-1/2) is equal to:`, 
     `You: f(-1/2) is equal to 4/5`, 
     `User: Why is the sky blue?`, 
     `Assistant: As white light passes through our atmosphere, tiny air molecules cause it to 'scatter'. The scattering caused by these tiny air molecules (known as Rayleigh scattering) increases as the wavelength of light decreases. Violet and blue light have the shortest wavelengths and red light has the longest.`,
